Otrera is an open source role-playing game development system. 
With Otrera, you can design original table top game engines
from scratch, or make new games on top of existing systems.

The Otrera Python library (this repository) is not currently
being actively developed. Right now the development team is
focused on creating the Otrera Webservice. This repository
serves as a kind of artifact for how the idea for the Otrera
Game Design tool came about, and will remain free and open
for people to examine.

With sufficient support from Kickstarter and retail users, we
hope to eventually release a free version of the webservice
and make more of the code open source.
