Otrera is an open source role-playing game development system. 
With Otrera, you can design original table top game engines
from scratch, or make new games on top of existing systems.

The Otrera Python library (this repository) is currently being
developed in parallel with a webservice that includes a GUI.
This library is still incomplete, and will only get minor
updates over the next month while the team begins putting
together the final product.
