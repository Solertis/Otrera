TODO (for contributors)
=======================

Comment here on github or e-mail TheWitchAgatha@gmail.com if you want to take a task.	

1. Add error checking (try/catch, etc) to methods

2. Add docstrings / comments

3. Improve CLI (help text, configurability with yaml, packaging)

4. Improve engine.py
	- This one is pretty complex. Contact me if you are up for a challenge.

5. Add CSV parsing and upload for default engine
	- The addContent and editContent modules should be the starting point
	- Ideally the program will tell users the right column/row format based on the engine

This TODO does not cover 'Engine Builder' goals. Those will be added here once the above five priorities are complete.
