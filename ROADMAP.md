PROJECT MILESTONES
==================

1. Game Builder -- GOAL 8/15/2014

	Users can build a game on top of a given engine. The engine.json file
	describes the constructs and templates that the addContent and editContent
	modules will use to define content. The finished game is a content.json file.

2. Engine Builder -- GOAL 10/31/2014

	Users can define constructs such as classes, races, attributes, etc. and then
	define their relationships. Definitions can simply be templates or can include
	specific instances - specific classes / races etc. These engine.json files can
	be used to create games (content.json).
